# Wolio V1 — Freeze Baseline

**Status:** freeze candidate, 2026-11-14. Design revision: `1.5`.

Read [DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY.md](DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY.md) for the complete active-document
register and [PROJECT_COVERAGE.md](00-product/PROJECT_COVERAGE.md) for how V1
(`BASELINE-V1.md`), V2 ([BASELINE-V2.md](BASELINE-V2.md)), and V3
([BASELINE-V3.md](BASELINE-V3.md)) fit together without collision.

This document defines the complete V1 product scope. Implementation is not implied
by design completion. The project owner records the actual freeze in
`.execution/baseline-acceptance.md` after reviewing this revision.

## Product decision

Wolio is an industrial-grade, contract-first programming language built specifically
for AI-assisted software construction. Its primary engineering goal is to eliminate
AI reward-hacking and workarounds ("akal-akalan")—such as swallowed errors,
hardcoded test-passing outputs, undeclared dependencies/effects, and silent contract
weakening—that turn fast AI coding into long-term technical debt.

Wolio deliberately trades away manual human coding brevity in favor of machine
verifiability: verbose explicit declarations (`dependencies [...]`, `effects [...]`,
`errors [...]`, nominal wrappers, and typed AST mutations) are accepted costs on
small programs because they enforce deterministic, low-defect scaling on large
industrial systems.

## Delivery profiles (V1: M01–M07)

| Profile | Delivery | Work units | Included | Exit evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend | M01 | T001–T004 | init, lexer (with V1+V2+V3 reserved keywords), parser, AST, JSON diagnostics | valid/invalid grammar fixtures |
| Executable core | M02 | T020–T024 | resolution, cycle rejection, nominal/record/enum types, Result/Option, exhaustive match, `sym_` IDs, interpreter, `run` | executable examples and negative type/cycle fixtures |
| Trial | M03 | T030–T034 | `requires`/`ensures` guards, static error/effect/dependency sets, `test`/`verify`, `inspect`/`impact`, pilot benchmark | contract failures, three change cycles, raw pilot results |
| Agent | M04 | T040–T044 | local JSONL protocol, typed AST mutation plans, scope/approvals, CAS/journal recovery, `WOLIO-ANALYZER-001`..`005` | stale/rejected/accepted mutation and anti-workaround fixtures |
| Native | M05 | T050–T053 | typed IR, `VerifiedWolioIr` verifier, LLVM lowering, C/runtime ABI, interpreter/native parity | interpreter/native differential corpus |
| Evaluation | M06 | T060–T063 | 10-task contract-first benchmark across Wolio, Go, Rust, TypeScript (200 runs; 24-task algorithmic benchmark in V2 T215) | reproducible bootstrap report, including negative findings |
| Toolchain | M07 | T070–T074 | Git packages, SHA-256 cache/offline lock, canonical formatter, LSP, Linux x86_64 archive | offline locked build, format idempotence, editor diagnostics |

`M03` is a legitimate standalone trial checkpoint. `M04` and `M05` independently
depend on `M03`. `M06` requires `M04`. `M07` depends on `M04` and `M05`. Full V1
ends at `M07`. Loops, collections (`List`, `Map`), `Decimal`, pure `predicate`
helpers, and `[architecture]` module policies belong to [BASELINE-V2.md](BASELINE-V2.md);
the standard library (`std::*`), capability-gated I/O mocks, `Secret<T>`,
transactions, and contract fuzzing belong to [BASELINE-V3.md](BASELINE-V3.md).

## Revision 1.5 decisions

Revision 1.5 incorporates critical architecture and vibe-coding optimizations
to ensure Wolio serves as a robust systems language for large-scale enterprise
construction without scope bloat:
1. **Keyword Forward-Reservation:** Expanded Set 3 forward-reserved keywords to
   23 words by adding `with_mock`, `where`, `fn`, and `foreign` (for Systems FFI),
   guaranteeing zero source collisions across V1, V2, and V3.
2. **LLM Mutation Ergonomics:** Solved the JSON-AST verbosity paradox in
   `MUTATION_SCHEMA_V1` and `LOCAL_PROTOCOL_V1` by permitting canonical Wolio
   source code strings (`code: string`) in mutation payloads, parsed server-side
   into verified AST diffs while preserving 100% strict semantic bounds.
3. **Early Anti-Hardcoding Defense:** Added automated scalar boundary and property
   fuzzing (`wolio verify --fuzz`) with `WOLIO-VERIFY-002` in M03 (`T032`),
   defeating AI test-overfitting on scalar types directly in V1.
4. **Rescoped V1 Benchmark:** Refined M06 from a 960-run matrix into a 10-task
   Contract & Protocol Benchmark (200 runs) evaluating contract verification,
   error handling, and agent repair vs Go, Rust, TS; the 24-task algorithmic
   benchmark matrix is formally scheduled for V2 M11 (`T215`).
5. **Crate Consolidation:** Consolidated the compiler middle-end into
   `crates/wolio-semantic` (submodules `resolver`, `types`, `graph`, `contracts`,
   `effects`, `analyzer`), reducing workspace crate count from 19 to 14 and
   eliminating cyclic dependency hazards.
6. **Hermetic Native Lowering:** Pinned native codegen in `wolio-codegen` to
   verified textual LLVM IR (`.ll`) emission and `clang` compilation, eliminating
   brittle Cargo C++ FFI build risks (`llvm-sys`/`inkwell`).
7. **Conformance Fixture Header Standard:** Specified the standard machine-readable
   test header format (`// @mode:`, `// @expect-status:`, `// @expect-code:`) across
   `tests/conformance/`.
8. **Compacted Systems Roadmap:** Aligned the full systems capabilities across V1
   (scalar & IR foundation), V2 (bitwise ops, exact math), and V3 (capability-gated
   FFI & fixed-width integers), strictly avoiding a separate V4.

## Freeze and amendment

Freeze fixes product behavior, feature boundaries, acceptance cases, and schema
versions. An amendment after owner freeze requires an ADR containing old/new
rules, rationale, compatibility, affected fixtures/tasks, and owner decision.
